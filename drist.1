Use persistent ssh connection, allowing ssh only once for the
different steps.  This uses ControlMaster feature from ssh(1).
.Pp

.Sh DESCRIPTION
drist is a tool to configure remote servers using ssh(1) and
scp(1) by uploading files and executing scripts.
.Pp
When run without 'f', 'F', or 'S' optional switches, drist will
look for a directory called "files" and/or a script called
"script" in the current working directory.
.Pp
- If the current working directory contains a directory called
either: 'files' or 'files-HOSTNAME' its contents are copied to the
suppled 'destination'.
.Pp
- If the current working directory contains a file called either: 'scrpt' 
or 'script-HOSTNAME' it is executed on 'destination' via a POSIX
shell.
.Pp
.Em NOTE
The 'HOSTNAME' string in: 'files-HOSTNAME' and 'sript-HOSTNAME', 
files are placeholder values. drist will connect to server via
ssh(1) and request the remote HOSTNAME by calling 'uname -n' and
if it matches the 'HOSTNAME' in the directory/file name's their
contents will be uploaded and/or executed on the remote host (e.g.
a directory called: "files-server.local" would only copy files to
a host who's hostname is: "server.local").
.Pp
.Em NOTE
drist uploads files to the remote host into a temporary directory
(e.g. ~/.drist_files_XXXXXXXX) before moving them from temporary
direcotry to the $(HOME) directory.
