v2.05 - 2025-12-19
==================

- Fixed a few variable quote errors.
- Fixed a few default variable values.
- Remote file copy (aka tar command) cleanup.
- Fixed variable names in `copy_single_file()`.
- Fixed variable names in `remote_script()`.
- Fixed variable names in `delete_temp()`.
- Updated man page for better explanation about how "files" and
  "script" are treated on remote host.
- Switched from the use of `scp` to a tar pipeline via ssh to copy
  files to remote host.
- Added license to drist script.
- Fixed spelling errors.
- Removed older examples.
- Added new examples with 'readmes'.

v2.04 - 2025-12-16
==================

- Replaced `getopt()` argument parsing with custom version to better
  handle a "-e [doas|sudo] situation instead of having to specify "-s
  and -e doas|sudo".
- Removed -s switch.
- Moved -i switch to -S switch to better conform to standard switch
  nomenclature. -i.e. -f is used to specify a directory whereas -F
  specifies a single file; -S is now used to specify a script file to
  match -F.

v2.03 - 2025-07-29
==================

- Switched from the use of `rsync` to `scp` to support usage from
  systems without `rsync` like in the case of a small jail or VM.
- Added '-i' flag to support specifying script to run (in lieu of
  having to change to directory where 'script' resides before launch).
- Added '-f' flag to support specifying files-directory to copy (in
  lieu of having to change to directory where 'files' resides before
  launch).
- "EXEC" defaults to use 'exec sh -c' to get a POSIX shell (defence
  against quirky remote shells).
- Added '-F' flag to support specifying a specific file to copy.
- Made `doas` default for elevated permissions instead of `sudo`.
- Added function headers.
- Minor syntax tweak (mostly, cosmetic).
- Made -s optional; if only -e switch is provided, -s is implied.
- Updated man page.

V2.02 - 2020-08-27
==================

- Fix an issue in which drist wasn't calling exit when the
  temporary directory can't be created

V2.01 - 2020-08-27
==================

- Document the use of a file containg hostnames and that
  drist now supports looping over multiple servers


V2.00 - 2020-08-26
==================

/!\ This update involves major changes, don't use it unless
    you can afford to rewrite all your drist modules.

- remove simulate mode
- remove "absent" support
- files are now copied under ~/.drist_files_XXXXXX which mean
  files must be moved to the system from the script (using
  rsync, install whatever)

This solves many issues:
	- you can't destroy your system because of rsync
	  removing symlink to replace them by directories
	  (common on FreeBSD where /home is a link to /usr/home)
	- files aren't available on the system with a permission
	  derived from the origin server, they can be properly copied
	  with the correct permissions and ownership from the script
	- absent function was not useful
	- simulate option was not useful

V1.05 - 2020-07-01
==================
