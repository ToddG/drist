config diff --

This example preforms a diff(1) between a local config file and a remote version.

Option 1 (while inside the `config-diff` directory):

        # drsit ACME

Option 2 (from outside the `config-diff` directory):

        # drist -f ./path/examples/config-diff/files/ -S ./path/examples/config-diff/script ACME
