ZFS Log Compression --

In the blog entitled "ZFS Log Compression on FreeBSD" (link below) there was an Ansible play to automate the steps listed out in the article however, Ansible requires Python. This example demonstrates the steps in the article on a remote system--without Python installed.

NOTE:
This example will create a backup of the `/etc/crontab` and `/etc/newsyslog.conf` file to the `/var/backups/drist` directory before editing.

        % drist -e ACME

Option 2 (from outside the `FreeBSD_ZFS-Log_Compression` directory):
   Run `script` on 'ACME' host with elevated permissions (`doas`).
        % drist -e -S ./path/examples/FreeBSD_ZFS-Log_Compression/script ACME
