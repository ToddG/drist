everything in this fork has been horribly broken by me.
do not use anything here.
i'll delete this repo soon.

# drist

*_NOTE_*: This is a fork of the origional drist. See the [HISTORY](#history)
section below.

## BRIEF

drist is a tool to configure and synchronize configurations to, and/or run
scrips on remote host(s) via ssh(1).

## SYNOPSIS

    drist [-p] [-d] [-x | [-X secrets-file]] [-e] [-S script-to-run] [-f files-to-copy-directory] [-F single-file-to-copy] [-T tempdir] destination [...]


## DESCRIPTION

Remote host configuration preformed with files and scripts without any special
configuration syntaxes/languages, daemons, or agents. drist relies on base
tools like sed(1), sudo(1)and ssh(1) and aims at being a simple to use and a pluggable
automation tool.


When executed without optional "-F", "-f", "-S" flags, drist will execute the
following steps from the current working directory:

1. If folder 'files' or 'files-HOSTNAME'  exists, its content is copied to
   server.
2. If file 'script' or 'script-HOSTNAME' exists, executed on remote server via
   ssh(1).

In the previous list, files are copied to or scripts executed on remote server
if it's hostname matches 'HOSTNAME' (e.g. a directory called:
"files-server.local" would only copy files to a host whos hostname is:
"server.local").

If the 'folder' or the 'script' file does not exist, drist will skip it.

drist also supports execution from a different working directory via the use of
optional command flags to specify the script or files to be uploaded. See the
options and examples sections below.

## DEPENDENCIES

* sh
* ssh
* sudo **
* tar
* openssl

** sudo is the only package nec to install:

    pkg query -e '%a = 0' %o | grep sudo
    security/sudo

## OPTIONS

| FLAG | DESCRIPTION                                                         |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -p   | Use persistent ssh connection, allowing ssh only once for the different steps.  This uses ControlMaster feature from ssh(1).   |
| -d   | Truncate reported hostname.  Tells drist to truncate the reported remote hostname to the left-most component.
| -e   | Execute as priviliged command (as root) on the remote server via binary.  Sudo only.
| -S   | (script) Use a specified script instead of a file called `script` found in local directory.
| -f   | (directory) Use a specified directory to upload instead of a local directory of `files` directory.
| -F   | (file) A single file to upload instead of one found in a `files` directory.
| -x   | Use default secrets file, 'secrets'. This is an encrypted file that will be decrypted as part of this command.
| -X   | (file) Use the specified secrets file. This is an encrypted file that will be decrypted as part of this command.
| -T   | (directory) Use the specified directory on the remote
| destination | Specify the remote servers you want drist to work on. The destination can be a file containing a list of hosts, one per line or it can be addresses passed in the command line. If you specify multiples servers, drist will loop over the list respecting the list order.  Note that only one file can be used in the command line.|

## Secrets

Command to manually encrypt a plaintext secrets ini file:

    openssl enc -base64 -aes-256-cbc -md sha512 -pbkdf2 -iter 1000000 -e -salt -in secrets.ini -out secrets.enc

NOTE: secrets file format is KEY=VALUE:

    server_a=12345&*("
    server_b=78900abc"

Command to manually decrypt an encrypted secrets ini file:

    openssl enc -base64 -aes-256-cbc -md sha512 -pbkdf2 -iter 1000000 -d -in secrets.enc -out secrets.txt

For drist to automatically decrypt the secrets file, it requires a secrets
password file. DO NOT check this file into your git repository. The encrypted
secrets file may be checked into your git repo, but (again) not the password
file for that secrets file.


## PORTABLE, FRICTIONLESS REMOTE DEPLOYS

drist is built for maximum reach: it only needs a POSIX-compatible
/bin/sh, an ssh(1) client and scp(1) on the control system. No heavy
runtimes, no daemon to install, no language-specific toolchains — just
the standard Unix tools that are already on most servers. That means
you can push scripts and files to systems (Linux, *BSD, minimal
containers, appliances that include a shell) with one tiny, auditable
script.

- **Minimal requirements:** POSIX sh(1) + ssh(1) + scp(1)
- **No persistent server-side service:** no need to install or run a
  client/server agent.  
- **Fast streaming transfers:** streams files over a single ssh(1)
  connection (reducing IO and latency).
- **Works over plain SSH:** leverages standard ssh(1) semantics and
  optional connection persistence (ControlMaster) when available so
  transfers are secure by default.
- **Streaming file transfer:** tar(1) over ssh(1) keeps transfers
  simple, fast, and compatible with both BSD/GNU tar(1).
- **Auditable & lightweight:** small, readable code you can audit in
  seconds — ideal for ops, incident response, and constrained
  environments.
- **Few dependencies (wide compatibility):** designed to run where
  heavyweight tooling can’t.

Use drist when you want a small, dependable tool that just works with
the ubiquitous Unix toolset.

## BUILD
default install location: /usr/local/bin
default man path location: /usr/local/share/man/man1
```sh
    # doas make install
```

To change the default install locations the included "configure"
script can be used.

```sh
    # ./configure --preflix=/location/to/instal/to
    # ./configure --mandi=/location/for/man/pages
 ```

## EXAMPLES
The following examples demonstrate usage with the optional file and directory specifier flags for clarity.

Upload and execute a script ("setup.sh") on the ACME host.
```
   # drist -S /place/where/scripts/reside/setup.sh ACME
```

Upload and execute a script ("setup.sh") on the ACME host using elevated permissions with `doas`.
```
   # drist -e -S /place/where/scripts/reside/setup.sh ACME
```

Upload and execute a script ("setup.sh") on the ACME host using elevated permissions with `sudo`.
```
   # drist -e sudo -S /place/where/scripts/reside/setup.sh ACME
```

Upload a file ("upload.file") to the ACME host.
```
    # drist -F /place/where/files/reside/upload.file ACME
```

Upload all files in a directory to the ACME host.
```
    # drist -f /place/where/files/reside/ ACME
```
